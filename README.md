# 42 C++ Modules
# Summary
This project is a structured introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++, consisting of 10 modules (CPP00 - CPP09). Each module focuses on different aspects of C++ development, gradually introducing more advanced concepts.

# Modules Overview
## ðŸ“Œ CPP00 - Basics of C++ & First Steps in OOP
- Introduction to C++ syntax, I/O streams, and string manipulation.
- Learn to use classes properly, work with std::string, and avoid C-style coding practices. <br>
[**CPP00**](https://github.com/tranhieutrung/CPP/tree/main/CPP00)
## ðŸ“Œ CPP01 - Memory Allocation & References
- Learn pointers, references, and dynamic memory allocation in C++.
- Implement a Zombie class, manage dynamic memory allocation, and explore stack vs heap memory. <br>
[**CPP01**](https://github.com/tranhieutrung/CPP/tree/main/CPP01)
## ðŸ“Œ CPP02 - Operator Overloading & Fixed-Point Numbers
- Learn Orthodox Canonical Form (OCF) and operator overloading.
- Implement a fixed-point number class and overload arithmetic/comparison operators. <br>
[**CPP02**](https://github.com/tranhieutrung/CPP/tree/main/CPP02)
## ðŸ“Œ CPP03 - Inheritance & Multiple Inheritance
- Understand class inheritance and constructor/destructor chaining.
- Implement ClapTrap, ScavTrap, FragTrap, and DiamondTrap using virtual inheritance to avoid duplicate ClapTrap instances. <br>
[**CPP03**](https://github.com/tranhieutrung/CPP/tree/main/CPP03)
## ðŸ“Œ CPP04 - Polymorphism & Abstract Classes
- Learn subtype polymorphism, virtual functions, and abstract classes.
- Implement an Animal hierarchy (Dog & Cat) with Brain deep copies and an interface-like Materia system. <br>
[**CPP04**](https://github.com/tranhieutrung/CPP/tree/main/CPP04)
## ðŸ“Œ CPP05 - Exception Handling & More Operator Overloading
- Introduces exceptions and custom exception classes.
- Practice more advanced operator overloading and exception safety. <br>
[**CPP05**](https://github.com/tranhieutrung/CPP/tree/main/CPP05)
## ðŸ“Œ CPP06 - Casts & Type Conversions
- Learn and apply the C++ casting operators: static_cast, dynamic_cast, and reinterpret_cast.
- Understand the difference between compile-time and runtime casting, and the risks of unsafe casts. <br>[**CPP06**](https://github.com/tranhieutrung/CPP/tree/main/CPP06)

## ðŸ“Œ CPP07 - Templates & Generic Programming
- Learn the power of templates in C++ to write generic and reusable code.
- Understand the difference between function templates and class templates.
- Learn how to separate template definitions between header and source files properly. <br>
[**CPP07**](https://github.com/tranhieutrung/CPP/tree/main/CPP07)
## ðŸ“Œ CPP08 - Standard Template Library (STL)

## ðŸ“Œ CPP09 - Data Structures & Algorithmic Thinking

# Conclusion
Completing these modules will helps in gaining a solid foundation in modern C++ development, covering everything from basic syntax to advanced OOP concepts and data structures.

ðŸš€ Happy coding!
