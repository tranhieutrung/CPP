# C++ Module 00
This module is your first step into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with C++. While C++ is an extension of C, it introduces many new concepts that help write better-structured and more efficient code. The goal is to encourage writing C++-style code instead of C-style code.

# Writing in a C++ Manner
To ensure that you are using C++ effectively, follow these principles:

✅ Use std::string methods such as .empty(), .length(), .substr(), etc., instead of manual character array manipulation.
✅ Do not use string indexing to iterate through characters. Instead, use range-based for loops for better readability and safety.
✅ Use C++ I/O streams (std::cin, std::cout) instead of printf() and scanf().
✅ Learn how to declare and use classes properly with member functions and constructors.

# Exercises
## Exercise 00: Megaphone
Write a program that converts input text to uppercase and prints it.

C++ techniques used:
✅ std::string methods (.empty(), .length(), etc.)
✅ Range-based for loops for character iteration
✅ std::cout instead of printf()

## Exercise 01: My Awesome PhoneBook
Create a simple phonebook program with two classes:
- PhoneBook: Stores up to 8 contacts and replaces the oldest when full.
- Contact: Represents a single contact.

C++ concepts practiced:
✅ Declaring and using classes properly
✅ Using constructors to initialize objects
✅ Reading from standard input (std::cin) and writing to standard output (std::cout)
✅ Managing fixed-size arrays (without malloc/free)

## Exercise 02: The Job Of Your Dreams (Optional)
Recreate the missing Account.cpp file based on the provided Account.hpp and test files. Your goal is to pass all the tests while following C++ best practices.
