# C++ Module 00
This module is my first step into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with C++. While C++ is an extension of C, it introduces many new concepts that help write better-structured and more efficient code. The goal is to encourage writing C++-style code instead of C-style code.

# Writing in a C++ Manner
To ensure using C++ effectively, follow these principles:

✅ Use std::string methods such as .empty(), .length(), .substr(), etc., instead of manual character array manipulation.<br>
✅ Do not use string indexing to iterate through characters. Instead, use range-based for loops for better readability and safety.<br>
✅ Use C++ I/O streams (std::cin, std::cout) instead of printf() and scanf().<br>
✅ Learn how to declare and use classes properly with member functions and constructors.<br>

# Exercises
## Exercise 00: Megaphone
Write a program that converts input text to uppercase and prints it.

C++ techniques used:<br>
✅ std::string methods (.empty(), .length(), etc.)<br>
✅ Range-based for loops for character iteration<br>
✅ std::cout instead of printf()<br>

## Exercise 01: My Awesome PhoneBook
Create a simple phonebook program with two classes:
- PhoneBook: Stores up to 8 contacts and replaces the oldest when full.
- Contact: Represents a single contact.

C++ concepts practiced:<br>
✅ Declaring and using classes properly<br>
✅ Using constructors to initialize objects<br>
✅ Reading from standard input (std::cin) and writing to standard output (std::cout)<br>
✅ Managing fixed-size arrays (without malloc/free)<br>

## Exercise 02: The Job Of Your Dreams (Optional)
Recreate the missing Account.cpp file based on the provided Account.hpp and test files. The goal is to pass all the tests while following C++ best practices.
